# Why e18e

The e18e project is an effort to bring together the groups and individuals
who are passionate about improving performance of the web ecosystem.

Many ongoing efforts are already happening in this space, from
[dependency tree cleanups](https://github.com/43081j/ecosystem-cleanup)
to [performance optimisations](https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem/),
and much more.

Our aim is to provide a space for like minded people to contribute to this
effort, and to document what we can about how you can contribute or benefit
from it.

This breaks down into three areas usually:

- [speedup](./speedup.md) - speeding up parts of the ecosystem many of us
depend on
- [levelup](./levelup.md) - documenting and providing modern, lighter
alternatives to established tools and libraries we all regularly use
- [cleanup](./cleanup.md) - cleaning up dependency trees and modernising
popular tools and libraries across the ecosystem

Often, efforts cross over into more than one of these categories.
